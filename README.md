# Hi there 👋, I'm Nathaniel Walser

I'm a 24-year-old fullstack developer based in Saint Gallen, Switzerland. My fascination with technology and robotics has led me to pursue programming, constantly improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. I enjoy creating software algorithms, including neuronal networks for surface inspection and quality assurance.

I am currently pursuing a **Systems Engineering** bachelors-degree at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.

In my free time, I fly quadrocopters and develop plugins for fully autonomous autopilots.
